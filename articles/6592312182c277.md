## はじめに

macOS版のVisual Studio CodeをVoiceOverスクリーンリーダーで操作できるか検証した結果をメモします。内容は随時更新します。ある程度内容が増えたらZennのbookとして整理する予定です。

テスト環境

- macOS Monterey 12.5.7
- Visual Studio Code  Version: 1.96.2

## インストール方法

Apple Silicon対応のバイナリがzipアーカイブで提供されています。展開すると、現在のディレクトリに「Visual Studio Code.app」が現れます。FinderでOpenしてApplicationフォルダに移動するか、ターミナルでunzipしてmvするか、方法は何でもOK。

## アンインストール方法

挙動がおかしくなったと感じたら完全にアンインストールしましょう。以下のスクリプトを実行します。

（現時点で確認した内容なので将来アプリケーションの構造が変化する恐れあり）

```bash
rm -rf "/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app"
rm -rf "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code"
rm -rf "$HOME/Library/Caches/com.microsoft.VSCode"
rm -rf "$HOME/Library/Caches/com.microsoft.VSCode.ShipIt"
rm -rf "$HOME/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.VSCode.plist"
rm -rf "$HOME/Library/Saved Application State/com.microsoft.VSCode.savedState"
```

## 起動直後の画面

アクセシビリティに関連した、知っておくと役に立つ情報が表示されます。情報はリスト形式で表示されていて、11個の項目があります。

初期状態はすべての項目が閉じられています。`VO + 左右カーソルキー`で各項目に移動し、`VO + Space`を実行すると項目が開閉します。

**注意点**

- リストの項目は13個あると読み上げされますが、実際は11個です。12個目の項目は「Mark Done button」13個目の項目は「Next Section  button」です。
- 一度項目を開くと、その項目名の最初に「Inspect this in the accessible view (Option+F2).」という文章が追加されます。

例

- 開閉前: Use the accessibility help dialog to learn about features collapsed button, group 1 of 13
- 開閉後: Inspect this in the accessible view (Option+F2). Use the accessibility help dialog to learn about features collapsed button, group 1 of 13

VS Codeを閉じるか、Go backボタンで戻った後にもう一度選択すると読み上げは元に戻ります。

## 各項目の内容について

参考までに、テキストとして残します。
見出しのレベルはVS Codeに表示されているレベルと一致させています。

## Get Started with Accessibility Features

Learn the tools and shortcuts that make VS Code accessible. Note that some actions are not actionable from within the context of the walkthrough.

### Use the accessibility help dialog to learn about features

The accessibility help dialog provides information about what to expect from a feature and the commands/keybindings to operate them.
With focus in an editor, terminal, notebook, chat response, comment, or debug console, the relevant dialog can be opened with the Open Accessibility Help command.
Open Accessibility Help button
Tip: Use keyboard shortcut Option+F1 

### Screen reader users can inspect content line by line, character by character in the accessible view.

The accessible view is available for the terminal, hovers, notifications, comments, notebook output, chat responses, inline completions, and debug console output.
With focus in any of those features, it can be opened with the Open Accessible View command.

### Control the verbosity of aria labels

Screen reader verbosity settings exist for features around the workbench so that once a user is familiar with a feature, they can avoid hearing hints about how to operate it. For example, features for which an accessibility help dialog exists will indicate how to open the dialog until the verbosity setting for that feature has been disabled.
These and other accessibility settings can be configured by running the Open Accessibility Settings command.
