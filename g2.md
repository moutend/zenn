## Google OAuth consent screen

### What is the OAuth consent screen?

When you use OAuth 2.0 for authorization, your app requests authorizations for one or more scopes of access from a Google Account. Google displays a consent screen to the user including a summary of your project and its policies and the requested scopes of access.

### What are OAuth consent scopes?

Scopes define what kind of user data you'll ask to access on behalf of the user in the consent screen. See the [full list of available scopes](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes?hl=ja).

### What are sensitive API scopes?

Sensitive scopes require verification by Google before they may be presented to the user in a consent screen.

### What are restricted API scopes?

If an app uses restricted scopes, Google verifies that an app complies with the Additional Requirements for Specific API Scopes .
See the current list of restricted scopes .

### The app registration process

#### What information do I need?

In order to register your app, you'll need to tell Google:

- How you want to configure your app, including your user type and publishing status
- Your app name, user support email, and optional logo
- Your app homepage, privacy policy, and optional terms of service
- What user data you want to access via scopes
- A developer contact email

#### Will my app need to be verified by Google?

Your app might need to go through verification if your app is configured for external users, has the publishing state set to "In production", and meets one or more of the following:

- You want your application to display an icon or app name
- Your app requests authorization of any sensitive or restricted scopes
- The number of authorized domains for your apps exceeds the domain count limit for a project
- There are changes to the OAuth consent screen after your app has been approved

#### What if I don't verify my app?

Your app will be identified to users by its redirect location or other client data.
Users of unverified apps or your test builds will see an unverified app warning based on the OAuth scopes in the authorization request. This warning is to protect users and their data from deceptive applications.

#### How long does the verification process take?

Verifications that include new sensitive scopes are expected to take 3-5 days if you are responsive to follow-up email requests. User access to the app for existing approved scopes will not be impacted during the verification process.
The restricted scopes verification process checks for compliance in multiple areas. Verification is expected to take several weeks to account for clarification questions and re-submissions. It is common to experience many messages back-and-forth during this review process. Any outstanding items will be communicated to you in the verification thread. Failure to comply with these requirements will likely result in a rejection of your request.
Please ensure that all contacts associated with the verification of your project are included in the developer contact email field to avoid missing any key communications.

#### How many users can use my app?

Apps with a publishing status of "Testing" may request authorization from a Google Account in its list of test users.
Apps with a publishing status of "In production" must complete verification for all requested sensitive and restricted scopes. An app requesting unverified sensitive or restricted scopes will result in the display of [unverified app warnings](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/7454865?hl=ja), which may prevent user authorization. See [OAuth user quotas](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/7454865?hl=ja#oauth-quota) for more information about user authorization limitations while your app's use of these scopes is unverified.
In addition, if your app requests access to scopes other than basic profile scopes commonly used for login (e.g. openid, email, profile), there will be a per-minute and per-day quota of how many token grants the Google OAuth API endpoints will allow for your app. Your current token grant rate and quota is displayed in the OAuth rate limits section.

#### Domain verification

We require verification of the first domain component after the public suffix used by your domain registry.
The list of domains requiring verification includes the domains of your provided application homepage, application privacy policy, and application terms of service. Projects that include web OAuth client types will need to verify the domains associated with the redirect URIs and authorized JavaScript origins used by its web clients.
Domain ownership is verified through Google Search Console for one or more of the Google Accounts associated with the project.

### What else should I review?

Review [Google's OAuth 2.0 Policies](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/policies?hl=ja) for more information about building apps that meet our minimum security and privacy requirements.
Review your project's owners and editors in the IAM panel to maintain a relevant list of contacts for the project.
